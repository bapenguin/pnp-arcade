# Massacre of the Fairies: project memory

Browser port (TypeScript + Vite + Canvas 2D + Web Audio) of a 2004 VB6/DirectX 7 game by
P&P Enterprises (the repo owner's own game). All seven port phases are done, plus a
modernization pass. It's part of the P&P Classic Arcade repo: see the root `CLAUDE.md`.
**Live:** https://bapenguin.github.io/pnp-arcade/games/mof/.

- `README.md`: controls, running, deploying.
- `PLAN.md`: original port plan, the bugs found in the VB code, and a status log of
  every phase. It's the history; this file is the working guide.

## Setting up on a new computer

1. Install **Git** and **Node.js 24 LTS**. (On Windows: `winget install Git.Git OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`.)
   **ffmpeg** is only needed to re-convert sounds (`winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`).
2. `git clone https://github.com/bapenguin/MoF.git` then `npm install`.
3. `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173. `npm run build` → `dist/`.

**The raw original media is NOT in git** (~180 MB of BMP/WAV/AVI under `legacy/`, gitignored).
The converted, web-ready versions in `public/assets/` and `public/icons/` *are* committed, so
playing, building and deploying all work from a fresh clone. Only `npm run assets` (re-converting
art/sound, regenerating icons) needs the raw files: copy `legacy/BG`, `legacy/fg`, `legacy/Sprites`,
`legacy/sfx` and the root-level `legacy/*.bmp` over from the original machine (`D:\Development\Fairy\legacy`).
`npm run data` works without them (the scenario `.txt` files are committed).

`npm run upscale` (2x art for phones, see `MOBILE_PLAN.md`) also needs the raw files, plus the
Real-ESRGAN Windows build (`realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan-20220424-windows.zip` from the
xinntao/Real-ESRGAN GitHub releases) unzipped to `tools/bin/realesrgan/` (gitignored). Output goes
to `public/assets/hd/` (committed, like the 1x art); review it at `/tools/upscale-review.html` on
the dev server. Then run `npm run redraw` (no extra tools needed): it draws the HD score pop-ups
and the "Howie Ammo" crate as SVG, since their small text smears when upscaled (`upscale`
skips those keys).

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/engine/` | Engine: fixed 60 Hz loop + scene manager (`engine.ts`), sprite sheets with per-pixel hit masks (`sprites.ts`), Web Audio (`audio.ts`), pointer/keys (`input.ts`), letterbox scaling (`screen.ts`), asset manifest (`assets.ts`), HUD text (`text.ts`) |
| `src/game/world.ts` | The gameplay simulation, ported from `legacy/modfairy.bas`: fairies, shooting, all 9 weapons, gore, gifts, score, streaks, shake, interpolation. `Session` = state across levels |
| `src/game/` (rest) | `data.ts` scenario types/loaders, `weapons.ts`, `weather.ts` (rain/snow/lightning), `profiles.ts` (localStorage players + stars), `settings.ts` (options + `DIFFICULTY`), `share.ts` (Massacre share links), `victory.ts` (end cards), `preload.ts` |
| `src/scenes/` | `menu.ts` (main menu, login, scenario + level select, options, stats, Hall of Fame, quit), `play.ts` (level flow, HUD, pause, summary/stars, game over/retry), `massacre.ts` (Massacre builder), `loading.ts` |
| `src/ui/dom.ts` | `h()` helper for the HTML menu overlay (`#ui`), laid out in logical 1024×768 px |
| `data/` | Generated JSON (scenarios, Massacre roster, `renames.json`). **Don't hand-edit**: change `tools/convert-data.mjs` and run `npm run data` |
| `tools/` | `upscale-assets.mjs` (defringe + Real-ESRGAN x4plus → 2x art in `public/assets/hd/`) + `upscale-review.html`, `redraw-text-art.mjs` (SVG redraws of the HD art with small text), `convert-assets.mjs` (BMP→PNG/WebP with black colour key, WAV→MP3, menu art out of `.frx` files, icons), `convert-data.mjs` (`.txt`→JSON + `RENAMES` + `PATCHES`), `sw.template.js` (service worker) |
| `public/` | Committed converted assets, icons, `manifest.webmanifest`, favicon |
| `legacy/` | Original VB6 source and data, for reference. Leave unchanged |
| `vite.config.ts` | `base: './'` (works in any folder) + plugin that generates `dist/sw.js` with the precache list |

## Conventions and decisions

- **Faithful port first.** Original behaviour is kept unless it was clearly a bug; every
  deliberate change is commented in the code ("The original…") and logged in `PLAN.md`.
- **Balance/content changes go in `tools/convert-data.mjs`**, never in `legacy/*.txt`:
  `RENAMES` (softened fairy names/ids; writes `data/renames.json`, which migrates saved
  profiles and Massacre setups) and `PATCHES` (e.g. Fairy Queen boss 1000→100 HP, the
  missing `blue` fairies in `fland`).
- **Decided, don't revisit unless asked:** the `dumbass.wav` clip and the "kick some fairy ass"
  caption baked into the quit-screen image stay as they are. Importing old `.guy` save files
  was declined.
- Timing is per fixed 60 Hz update (the original ran at vsync). `PlayScene` has its own clock
  (`this.time`) that stops while paused; use it, not `engine.now`, for gameplay timing.
- Player data, settings and Massacre setups live in the browser's `localStorage`
  (`mof.profiles`, `mof.settings`, `mof.massacre`, `mof.lastPlayer`); nothing server-side.
- Match the surrounding code's style: small modules, comments explain *why*, TypeScript strict.

## Deploying

- **Where it deploys from:** the arcade's root workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml` at
  the repo root) builds this folder and publishes it at `/games/mof/`. See the root
  `CLAUDE.md` for the details.
- **The old standalone repo:** `bapenguin/MoF` (tag `mof-standalone-v1`) is the archived
  version.
- Offline play/installing (service worker) needs HTTPS. Pages has it.
- For another server: upload the contents of `dist/` to any folder.

## Testing notes (for Claude)

- Verify changes in the browser, not just `tsc`: `npm run dev`, then drive the page.
- HD art: `?hd=1` / `?hd=0` force the 2x art on or off. The canvas only renders above 1x
  when the window is bigger than 1024x768 in device pixels; the preview pane is small at DPR 1,
  so emulate a big viewport (e.g. 2048x1536) to test it. Screenshots of an emulated viewport
  bigger than the pane come out wrong: read pixels or export `canvas.toBlob()` instead.
- Touch layout: `?touch=1` / `?touch=0` force the phone rails on or off; emulate a phone-landscape
  viewport (e.g. 844x390). Dispatch `pointerdown` with `pointerType: 'touch'` to test aim slack.
- The preview pane only runs `requestAnimationFrame` while it's being drawn, so the game loop
  (loading, updates, rail refreshes) can stall between tool calls. Taking a screenshot lets it
  run; don't mistake the stall for a hang.
- Dev-only hooks: `window.__play` (current `PlayScene`), `window.__engine`, `window.__audio`.
  Prefer these over `import('/src/...')` in page scripts: after an edit Vite serves a fresh
  module copy, so a dynamic import can get a different instance from the running game. After
  editing a shared module (e.g. `screen.ts`), even the game itself can end up with two copies
  (modules compiled before the edit keep pointing at the old one), which shows up as state that
  doesn't match. Restart the dev server with `npx vite --force` before trusting such a result.
  Production builds always have one copy.
- Synthetic clicks: dispatch `pointerdown`/`pointerup` on `#game` with client coords mapped
  from logical 1024×768. Useful bot: pick a live fairy, find an opaque pixel with
  `sheet.hit()`, click it.
- Each source edit triggers a full page reload in dev; re-run setup steps after editing.
- The Claude desktop preview browser **can't register service workers** and blocks clipboard
  writes. Check offline/install in real Chrome on the live site.
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 mangles double quotes inside `git commit -m` here-strings; use single
  quotes in the message (or the Bash tool).

## Possible next steps (from the modernization list, not started)

Gamepad support and a touch weapon wheel; online leaderboards and a daily seeded Massacre
(needs a small backend); a scenario editor ("Fairies In Space" add-on packs); new fairy
behaviours; AI-upscaled art; a gore toggle / reduced-flash option; separate volume sliders.
